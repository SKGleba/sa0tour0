# This guide applies ONLY to Playstation Vita/TV models with ENSO NSKBL hack installed and running.
# Introduction:
This tool allows you to redirect systemdata (fonts, dictionary, handwriting) to ur0 or ux0.

It is useful for people who wants to customize fonts (modding sa0 may lead to a brick).

# Installation:
1) Download and install the provided VPK file.

2) Copy the /data/ folder from sa0 to ur0 or ux0 and reboot the console.

3) Open the app and choose what part of systemdata (i.e *.pvf* fonts) you want to redirect or press [SELECT] to redirect everything.

4) Choose the new location (i.e ur0:data/font/pvf/ for *.pvf* fonts)

5) It should take few seconds to complete, and after it finishes reboot the console.

# FAQ:
 - Q: Can i delete other (not used) folders from the /data/ folder?
   - A: Yes
 - Q: How to modify fonts?
   - A: Download any ‘.otf’ font, rename it to ltn0.pvf, and put in the /data/font/pvf/ (pvf fonts are just renamed otf)
 - Q: Why should I use this and not XXXX?
   - A: It provides full compatibility with all games/apps and firmwares.
 - Q: Why it redirects all fonts instead of one?
   - A: I created this tool to safely experiment with fonts, hwr, and dics. If you want to redirect one file you may use fontRedirect by cxziaho (not compatible with most of games/apps and fws).
 - Q: I did a bad redirect/i installed a bad font/i dont have text/everything errors out.
   - A: If you cant access the app - reinstall firmware via safemode.
 - Q: You did a great job! How can i help/donate you?
   - A: paypal.me/skgleba (thx! ^_^)
# Useful notes:
- Do NOT uninstall enso while systemdata is redirected, if you did it and cant access the app - reinstall firmware via safemode.
